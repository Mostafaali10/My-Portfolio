3. **Set up MongoDB**
   - Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally or provide a connection string for a cloud database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     PORT=5000

## Contact Form Functionality
